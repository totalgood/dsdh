# # Data Science for Digital Health Glossary
# To make room for new concepts we compress complex concepts into words.
# And then we can compress several words into acronyms to consolidate multiple complex concepts under one "umbrella" concept.
# Smart people can think analogously across domains, sharing words and concepts and brain neurons between domains.

Endogenous variable: "A variable is said to be endogenous within a causal model if its value is determined or influenced by one or more of the independent variables driving the model predictions. This may also sometimes be referred to as the outcome variable or the output of a causal model. See Also: *target variable*, *predicted variable*, *dependent variable* #data-science"
Exogenous variable: A variable is said to be exogenous for a causal model if its value influences or determines the independent or endogenous variables. These exogenous variables may or may not be measured or controled for and if they are not they are call confounding variables or confounders.  #data-science
confounder: [confounding variable]
confounding variable: "See Also: *confounder* #data-science"
target variable: "The dependent variable or the variable you want to predict using a data science or machine learning model. See Also: *target* #data-science"
target: [target variable, endogenous variable, predicted variable, target variable]
dependent variable: [endogenous variable, predicted variable, target variable, target]
predicted variable: [dependent variable, endogenous variable, target variable, target]
probability: The likelihood that an even will occur. The proportion of events that would result in one particular outcome in the limit as the number of trials (events such as dice rolling) approaches infinity. #statistics #data-science
complementary rule: "The idea that the probability of one even is equal to one minus the probability of it's complement (logical oposite). In math: P(A) = 1 - P(not A)."

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD): A developmental disorder that affects communication and behavior. It is called a *developmental disorder* because symptoms generally appear in the first two years of life. It is called a *spectrum disorder* because a wide range of behaviors are associated with the condition and these behaviors a often ranked on a linear scale from less severe to more sever. #medicine #neuroscience #clinical #healthcare #psychology

Uncanny Valley: In 1970 Masahiro Mori coined the phrase "Uncanny Valley" to refer to the dip in user satisfaction with humanoid robotic faces and bodies when they get too good uncannily good at imitating human behavior, but not good enough for us to forget that they are a simulation or a computer program. This may be due to our finely tuned instinct to read facial expressions and look for signs of illness or psychological instability in the faces of other humans. This is also called the "Mori Uncanny Valley." #nlp #robotics #ai #data-science #healthcare
