# # Data Science for Digital Health Glossary
# To make room for new concepts we compress complex concepts into words.
# And then we can compress several words into acronyms to consolidate multiple complex concepts under one "umbrella" concept.
# Smart people can think analogously across domains, sharing words and concepts and brain neurons between domains.

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD): A developmental disorder that affects communication and behavior. It is called a *developmental disorder* because symptoms generally appear in the first two years of life. It is called a *spectrum disorder* because a wide range of behaviors are associated with the condition and these behaviors a often ranked on a linear scale from less severe to more sever. #medicine #neuroscience #clinical #healthcare #psychology

Chromosome: DNA molecule with part or all of the genetic material (genome) of an organism often including packaging proteins which help maintain the 3D structure of the lengthy sequence of nucleic acids and chaperone proteins which aid in accurate transcription of the DNA into RNA and proteins. The cells of the human body each contain 46 chromosomes, or 23 pairs of duplicate chromosomes. #genomics #healthcare
CV (Computer Vision): Processing images for classification, segmentation, or object detection or processing video for object tracking and SLAM. This term is often used to referred to \"classical\" computer vision algorithms based on human-crafted algorithms like HOG and SIFT, rather than machine learning or deep learning models like VGG16, ImageNet, or SSD neural networks. #data-science #deep-learning #computer-vision #L1
Degeneracy: When referring to genetic code, this is the fact that some SNPs and SNVs do not significantly change the amino acid sequence (protein) produced by that gene. #healthcare #genomics

EHR (Electronic Health Records): In the US managed healthcare plans such as those administered by Kaiser have led the way in consolidating patient records into a normalized electronic database that can be accessed patients, doctors, and insurers and shared across hospital systems in multiple states. EHRs are the fuel for the Data Science machine that promises to decouple quality and cost of healthcare.

Indicator variable: A variable used to quantify a binary categorical variable that answers a question like "Is the patient a smoker?" by answering with 0 and 1 in place of "no" and "yes" respectively. In the python scikit-learn (`sklearn`) package these are called "dummy" variables because they are often computed deterministically from another variable in your dataset containing categorical values like the strings "smoker" or "nonsmoker". #data-science #ml #data
Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU): An electronic package, usual a small chip within a smartphone, that measures your linear acceleration in 3 directions and rotational rate around 3 axis for a total of 6 measurements every few milliseconds. Sometimes a 7th measurement from a magnetic compass is added to measure the orientation of the phone relative to the Earth's magnetic field. These measurements can be used to track the relative motion of your phone over time. The 3-axis accelerometer can also be used to detect the absolute orientation of the phone relative to gravity.

Uncanny Valley: In 1970 Masahiro Mori coined the phrase "Uncanny Valley" to refer to the dip in user satisfaction with humanoid robotic faces and bodies when they get too good uncannily good at imitating human behavior, but not good enough for us to forget that they are a simulation or a computer program. This may be due to our finely tuned instinct to read facial expressions and look for signs of illness or psychological instability in the faces of other humans. This is also called the "Mori Uncanny Valley." #nlp #robotics #ai #data-science #healthcare
