00:10
I'm delighted to be here to see you all
00:13
on such a beautiful day not outside in
00:17
the sunshine so I'm going to talk about
00:21
tools for thinking one of my students
00:26
famously said or I love it you can't do
00:30
much carpentry with your bare hands you
00:32
can't do much thinking with your bare
00:33
brain oh by the way can I have the house
00:36
lights up I really like to see faces
00:38
this isn't a drama thank you I'll try to
00:43
make it entertaining but it's not you
00:46
know thank you
00:52
how many do you know about the Flynn
00:54
effect oh only a few okay named after
00:59
Jim Flynn James Flynn psychologist he
01:02
didn't do the original research but he's
01:05
drawn attention to the importance of it
01:08
it turns out that since the in the
01:12
hundred years that we've had IQ tests
01:14
scores have been going up IQ tests are
01:18
normalized at a hundred being the
01:20
average and that so you have to keep
01:22
tweaking that scoring system but if you
01:26
give the tests that you gave in 1932
01:33
people today they'll score on average a
01:37
hundred and thirty not a hundred at
01:42
least as the whole world over to it's
01:47
not it's not just in any one area at
01:49
least we're a lot better at taking IQ
01:52
tests than we were 8090 years ago but it
01:57
seems to be a real pattern and what's
01:59
what might cause that Flynn thinks that
02:03
what's happened is that the tools for
02:08
thinking that are developed and proved
02:13
and and refined in in the sciences and
02:16
then the other academic disciplines have
02:20
sort of filtered down into popular
02:22
culture and become part of the ambient
02:24
culture that you learn independently of
02:26
school and that this is why people are
02:30
actually thinking better they're
02:32
actually better problem solvers they see
02:35
patterns better and so forth in any case
02:38
it's a hypothesis that hasn't been
02:41
disproven and it has a good chance of
02:43
being the right the right answer to that
02:47
question and the reason I mention it is
02:48
because if you ask me wait a minute are
02:52
you saying that these thinking tools
02:54
actually make us smarter I'm saying yes
02:57
yes they do so what are some thinking
03:06
tools well par excellence the thinking
03:09
tools or words can't do much thinking
03:11
without words and I'm reminded of a
03:15
famous line of Goethe's when ideas fail
03:19
words come in very handy he really
03:23
didn't say that and when you think about
03:26
it you realize what wisdom is there when
03:29
the when the thinking gets really hard
03:31
you can often use words as a certain
03:35
sort of prosthetic device a crutch to
03:37
help you over some difficult stretches
03:42
numbers obviously our thinking tools
03:44
diagrams Maps methods of all kinds from
03:51
finding the average the long division to
03:54
cost-benefit analysis you name it notice
03:56
that these are all quite abstract things
03:59
they're they're techniques for handling
04:02
information in your head rather than
04:05
tools that you plug in or need a power
04:09
source for then there's intuition pumps
04:13
I coined the term way back in 1980 or 81
04:18
in order to talk about John Searles
04:22
famous or notorious Chinese room thought
04:25
paramount I said it's an intuition pump
04:27
and because I was on that occasion
04:30
criticizing a lot of people thought that
04:32
I meant the term intuition pump
04:34
pejoratively no I didn't actually and
04:37
I've since explained that I think
04:40
intuition pumps at their best are
04:42
wonderful they are the best
04:44
philosophical thinking tools there are
04:46
and they always have been if you look at
04:48
the history of philosophy Plato's cave
04:52
of Socrates teaching the slave boy
04:56
geometry they carts evil demon Hobbes
05:00
state of nature these are the these are
05:02
the great melodies of philosophy that
05:04
you remember long after you forgotten
05:07
the details of the arguments so
05:09
philosophers have always used intuition
05:11
pumps little stories scenarios vignettes
05:16
and they're not typically formal
05:20
arguments they're little stories it's
05:25
not like doing songs when you get to the
05:27
end you've got the answer
05:28
very few intuition pumps are like that
05:31
they're much more like Aesop's fables
05:34
you get the end there's a little moral
05:36
you hmm
05:37
interesting you'd put it that way and if
05:40
it really works you pound your fist on
05:42
the table so it's got to be that way
05:43
that's the intuition that's been pumped
05:45
now there are persuaders in other words
05:50
somebody wrote me the other day saying
05:52
well I've looked at your book now and I
05:56
think what you're really talking about
05:58
in every case you're talking about
05:59
social thinking you're talking about
06:01
persuading others it's it's very much
06:04
interpersonal and I wrote back said yes
06:07
and in fact I should have stressed that
06:09
more all really serious thinking is
06:12
interpersonal I think I think that's in
06:15
fact one of the keys to how we think is
06:20
by challenging each other with our ideas
06:25
lovely case in point
06:28
Andrew Wiles proved Fermat's Last
06:32
Theorem a few years back but nobody
06:35
could be sure even Wiles himself
06:38
couldn't be sure he'd done it until his
06:41
peers his colleagues in mathematics who
06:44
would dearly love to have the honor of
06:47
having proved Fermat's Last Theorem
06:49
themselves until they had signed off and
06:52
said darn it yes he's got it
06:54
congratulations
06:55
this competitive opponent process
07:01
between people is actually one of the
07:04
key intuition pumps are the key thinking
07:08
tools all on its own and so this is a
07:11
book very much about how to persuade
07:14
others and yourself about difficult
07:17
matters there are also tools of
07:19
discovery by exploring these vignettes
07:22
you uncut you encounter either problems
07:25
that you hadn't anticipated or sometimes
07:28
opportunities that you would not
07:29
otherwise notice and they hold our
07:32
attention you you can just refer back to
07:35
them and at least they give you a focus
07:38
on a topic that's very useful now some
07:43
fields of academic inquiry have lots of
07:47
fixed points just in moveable bedrock
07:50
philosophy I think has none hardly a one
07:55
maybe the law of non-contradiction
07:57
according to Aristotle what we have are
08:01
candidates for fixed points we say in
08:04
effect suppose for the sake of argument
08:06
we treat this and this and this at six
08:09
points now what follows from those three
08:11
points triangulate those see what kind
08:13
of a theory you can make of that see how
08:15
the questions look if we take those as
08:18
fixed points so very often an intuition
08:20
pump is a is a wonderful fixer of a
08:24
candidate for a fixed point and that's a
08:27
very valuable tool in itself how
08:31
powerful are these tools they're this
08:35
powerful they drove what is one of the
08:39
great biological phenomena in the
08:43
history of life on this planet
08:45
Paul MacCready the late great green
08:50
engineer if you don't know who Paul
08:52
MacCready is I'll probably be able to
08:54
identify it for you by drawing attention
08:56
the fact that he's the one who designed
08:59
and built the gulfs of gossamer
09:01
albatross
09:02
the human powered airplane that flew
09:05
across the British Channel he pointed
09:09
out that at 10,000 years ago a twinkling
09:12
engine in biological time at the very
09:15
dawn of Agriculture our species plus its
09:20
livestock and its pets was a fraction of
09:24
one percent of the by weight if you like
09:27
of the terrestrial vertebrate biomass a
09:31
minor primate
09:34
what is it today ten thousand years
09:38
later any guesses 99 percent eighty five
09:47
out here any others you know that's not
09:52
true there are a few bears out in the
09:56
woods but it's actually it's 98 percent
10:01
most of that's cattle but in ten
10:06
thousand years our species plus its
10:08
domesticated animals have completely
10:11
transformed the biosphere in a way that
10:17
really hardly I don't think any earlier
10:21
global event can compete with that for
10:24
the changes that have been wrought in
10:25
just ten thousand years and this is what
10:28
this is what McCready says about it over
10:31
billions of years on a unique sphere
10:34
chance is painted a thin covering of
10:37
life I love that image chance has
10:39
painted a thin covering of life complex
10:42
improbable wonderful and fragile
10:44
suddenly we humans have grown in
10:46
population technology and intelligence
10:49
to a position of terrible power we now
10:52
wield the paintbrush that's true
10:57
and we have the same genes that our
11:01
ancestors 10,000 years ago had they're
11:03
our ancestors a hundred thousand years
11:05
ago pretty much it's not genetic it's
11:08
thinking tools that have made this all
11:11
puff possible which raises a chicken-egg
11:15
problem did evolve tools make us smarter
11:18
or did we evolve to become smart enough
11:21
to make tools and the answer as to all
11:26
good chicken-egg problems is yes it's
11:32
co-evolutionary it's a sort of
11:34
bootstrapping thing where we get a
11:36
little bit smarter smart enough to make
11:38
a few tools and then those tools make a
11:40
smarter still and so it goes building
11:43
and building and building my next book
11:46
is going to be about that process so
11:50
some simple tools from the book
11:53
everybody knows reductio ad absurdum
11:55
even if you don't know the name it is
11:57
that you might say it's the great
11:59
crowbar of thought it is the way you
12:02
budge people from their position by
12:05
taking their premises saying well if we
12:09
assume for the sake of argument that
12:11
your premises are such-and-such look
12:14
what I can do and then you deduce
12:17
logically from those premises a
12:19
contradiction something absurd in fact
12:23
we use this all the time in more more
12:26
informally and don't even notice it but
12:28
it's really the same thing I mean if you
12:30
say if that's a bear then bears have
12:33
antlers that's really a sort of reductio
12:37
ad absurdum argument I mentioned it in
12:43
part because I want to point out that
12:45
although we use reductio ad absurdum
12:47
arguments in either expanded or
12:50
truncated form we also imply them all
12:54
the time using rhetorical questions a
12:56
rhetorical question whenever you see one
12:58
one of those questions it isn't supposed
13:00
to be answered stop and think about it
13:03
it's an implied reductio the idea is
13:06
haha you can't answer this question it
13:09
would be
13:10
it's it's so obvious that that the
13:14
answer to this question is so obvious
13:17
that I don't even have to mention what
13:20
the answer is everybody knows that's
13:22
nudge well that means that a good
13:28
practice a habit to get into is when you
13:31
see one of those question marks in a doc
13:34
document a rhetorical question try
13:37
answering the question and see if maybe
13:40
it's not so ridiculous after all
13:44
in one of my favorite peanuts cartoon
13:47
strips Charlie Brown says something like
13:50
well who's to say what is right and what
13:53
is wrong and Lucy says I will and try it
13:58
you'll like it sometimes you can really
14:01
bring a person up short by just
14:03
answering their their rhetorical
14:05
question then there's the Shirley alarm
14:09
I tell my students every time you see
14:13
the word Shirley a little bell should
14:14
ring ding and you should pause hearing
14:18
the Shirley alarm and you should look to
14:20
see if you have just found the weak
14:23
point in the argument why well
14:28
what follows the Shirley is a sentence
14:32
that the author wants you to believe is
14:36
putting forward is true it's not so
14:40
obvious that it goes without saying if
14:42
it were it would go without saying and
14:46
here the author is putting it in but not
14:50
bothering to argue for us instead trying
14:54
to get by on the cheap with a little
14:56
nudge a little Shirley so if you have a
15:01
Shirley alarm and this becomes just a
15:03
habit in your mind this this will stand
15:06
you in good stead I've been inviting
15:08
people to send me now that they've
15:10
installed a Shirley alarm in their brain
15:12
to tell send the examples where they
15:15
catch the catch of Shirley marking a
15:19
weak spot I did a little research on
15:21
this I actually went
15:23
and string search for surely in several
15:26
dozen actually more like 70 or 75
15:29
philosophy papers online and found a
15:32
couple of dozen Shirley's and check them
15:37
out and and about a third of them work I
15:40
thought clearly the weakest point in the
15:43
case being made in that in that article
15:45
it doesn't work all the time and a lot
15:47
of false alarms you can go ahead and use
15:50
the word shortly every now and then but
15:53
if you hear the word surely you should
15:54
ding so we just give it a little try
15:56
because surely if you I didn't hear it
15:59
if surely if you get in the habit of
16:03
whenever you hear the word surely a
16:05
little bell rings practice surely being
16:09
thank you now look what I've done I've
16:15
just downloaded and apt to your neck top
16:22
in the same way that an app on your on
16:26
your smartphone adds to the
16:28
functionality it gives gives your
16:30
smartphone a new talent a new capacity
16:33
it's like Google Alert or something like
16:36
that you now have another little tool in
16:40
your kit that may very well alert you to
16:44
a weak spot in some argument through
16:46
your otherwise impressed with okay
16:52
computers are of course thinking tools
16:55
par excellence and I there's a lot about
16:58
computers in the book and I have learned
17:01
from many years experience that a lot of
17:04
people think they understand how
17:05
computers work and they don't really and
17:06
if they just understood a bit more they
17:09
would understand a lot more things that
17:11
can be easily understood with the help
17:13
of computers so there's there's an
17:15
interlude on computers including what
17:18
must be an eccentric first in a trade
17:21
book there's actually a chapter which
17:24
teaches you how to program the world's
17:26
simplest computer a register machine and
17:29
there are even problem sets with the
17:32
answers at the back of the book if you
17:35
will spend a couple hours with that
17:38
chapter you will understand computers
17:40
the way you never understood them before
17:42
but of course you're free to pass over
17:46
that if you really don't care how long
17:51
by the way was a philosopher who came up
17:56
with the idea of a register machine
17:57
around the same time little after
17:58
girdle's famous proof and touring coming
18:03
up of the Turing machine and the the
18:05
long register machine this is is
18:09
computes everything that storing
18:11
computable so it's a it's a
18:12
user-friendly alternative to a Turing
18:16
machine if you've ever tried to program
18:18
a touring machine you know it's hard
18:20
it's very counterintuitive but a
18:22
register machine is very easy to
18:24
understand it's it's the world's
18:26
simplest computer and
18:29
are some little exercises on that now
18:32
here's some thinking tools
18:34
well actually this picture I want to
18:36
point out this is a this picture is all
18:38
by itself for thinking too it draws
18:40
attention to a rather striking
18:41
comparison and provokes reflection the
18:49
one on the left is in a chalet and
18:50
hand-axe the one on the right I don't
18:54
need to tell you notice the actual hand
18:58
axe was used in this form unchanged
19:00
without any noticeable improvements for
19:03
over a million years weird really
19:07
strange the mouse in comparison has only
19:13
been around for a few decades and is
19:17
probably on the way out the speed of
19:22
tool use and improvement is picked up a
19:26
little bit over biological time here's
19:31
another thinking tool all on its own the
19:33
comparison between these two entities on
19:37
the left you see an Australian termite
19:41
castle on the right you see gaudi's
19:44
famous Church in Barcelona the Sagrada
19:47
família they're strikingly similar in
19:50
appearance and actually in structure
19:52
even internally they're quite remarkably
19:55
similar
19:56
so here are two artifacts made by
19:58
animals looking very similar and yet
20:02
profoundly different in both the design
20:06
and construction the one on the left is
20:09
designed by Darwinian processes clueless
20:14
mindless little termites it's all local
20:17
action there's no there's no blueprint
20:19
there's no intelligent designer there's
20:21
no no boss there's no hierarchy it's
20:26
bottom-up construction in sort of every
20:29
sense of the word
20:31
whereas Gaudi is the very model of an
20:34
intelligent designer autocratic full of
20:39
manifestos and blueprints and orders
20:42
ordering the underlings around now
20:48
they're both natural and one of the
20:51
really interesting questions is how do
20:54
we get in this on this planet how did we
20:58
get from termites tile design and
21:01
construction to gaudí's style design
21:03
construction how did the second kind
21:07
evolved from the first that's a very
21:10
deep and interesting question that's the
21:12
one that I am now devoting as much time
21:15
as I can to and will attack in the next
21:18
book and I hope I'll be back to talk
21:20
about that one more visual thinking tool
21:24
is this my favorite picture of the Tree
21:27
of Life this is Leonard Eisenberg's and
21:30
you can you can get this as a big
21:32
beautiful glossy poster to put up on
21:35
your on your wall in your study or in
21:37
your classroom or you can get t-shirts
21:40
and buttons and all sorts of things
21:41
what's really nice about it is that so
21:45
many features that are important to
21:46
understand or rendered so vivid here's
21:50
the birth of the earth and time this is
21:52
four billion years ago and here's the
21:56
present out around the outside edge so
21:58
this represents all living things today
22:01
and this represents where it started and
22:04
we see that the bacteria in the archaea
22:07
came first then we had this amazing
22:10
event the the eukaryotic revolution when
22:14
an endosymbiotic event joined to
22:18
prokaryotes to simple cells into a
22:21
symbiotic Union and that was the first
22:24
eukaryotic cell and everything else
22:28
these are all eukaryotes to a first
22:33
approximation every living thing that's
22:35
big enough to see you the naked eye is a
22:37
eukaryotic
22:38
including you and me and oak trees and
22:43
fish and all the rest you can see some
22:47
important events here's the Cambrian
22:49
explosion 530 million years ago when
22:53
was this sudden influx of many different
22:56
life forms new body plans new ways of
23:00
making a living Steve Gould famously
23:02
wrote about that tremendous creative
23:05
period and way over here that little
23:08
that little fork right there that's
23:10
about seven billion years just from that
23:14
crotch right there seven million years
23:17
fuse me that's about the length of time
23:19
that we has passed since we shared a
23:22
common ancestor with the chimpanzee and
23:25
of course language and culture is just
23:28
right out here right out here so in in
23:31
in just what's happened just in the last
23:34
fine fringe is everything that's
23:37
transformed the world thanks to thinking
23:39
tools and notice it on this whole Tree
23:44
of Life the termites are on there the
23:48
the birds building their nests are on
23:50
there the first intelligent designers
23:54
show up on one twig in very recent times
23:59
in the last hundred thousand years or so
24:02
and becoming more intelligent as they go
24:06
now give you a few examples of intuition
24:10
pumps just because of so far I've just
24:12
been talking about simple tools here's
24:14
the nefarious neurosurgeon first a
24:19
little science fact da me and Denise in
24:24
Amsterdam has developed a little
24:27
microchip that can be surgically
24:29
implanted in your head if you suffer
24:31
from obsessive-compulsive disorder it
24:33
will control your obsessive compulsive
24:36
disorder quite well it's it's being
24:38
implanted in a lot of people today and
24:41
so far the results are good its
24:43
experimental but very promising
24:45
that's fact now fiction so you see one
24:49
day this fellow who has OCD goes to see
24:52
his neurosurgeon and asks her to implant
24:54
the Denis chip and she does and as she's
24:58
sewing him up and shaking his hand and
25:01
sending him out of her shiny surgery she
25:04
says oh yes your
25:06
OCD is a thing of the past it would be
25:08
completely controlled by the chip and by
25:10
the way our staff here will be
25:12
monitoring you 24/7 and electronically
25:16
we will be controlling all your
25:17
decisions from now on you will have the
25:21
illusion of free will but it's just an
25:23
illusion thank you have a nice life says
25:26
about the door he believes her well
25:30
shiny lab white lab coat neurosurgeon
25:34
and believing her he begins to act a
25:38
little bit irresponsibly he's a little
25:42
self-indulgent indulging his worst whims
25:45
becomes a little arrogant a little
25:47
aggressive and before long he gets in
25:49
trouble with the law
25:50
and he says to the judge but your honor
25:53
I don't have any free will the
25:56
neurosurgeon told me I don't have any
25:59
free will you can't hold me responsible
26:01
they call the neurosurgeon to testify
26:04
and she says under oath yeah I'm I told
26:08
him all right I was I was just messing
26:10
with his head you know I never thought
26:11
he'd believe me now I think we can all
26:17
agree can we not here's the intuition I
26:19
want to pump she did an awful thing that
26:23
was that was a really bad thing she did
26:25
to him she actually accomplished with
26:28
her words what she claimed to accomplish
26:32
surgically electronically she disabled
26:35
him as a free agent now if I've secured
26:41
that intuition then I can go on and say
26:44
to the neuroscientists of its design for
26:46
and so tell me exactly how is it that
26:49
your own recent pronouncements in many
26:51
books and popular articles the nurse
26:54
science shows that there is no free will
26:57
that free will is an illusion and I've
27:00
got quotes - exactly that effect from a
27:02
lot of very eminent people I say why
27:04
isn't that just doing wholesale what she
27:06
did retail why isn't that a really
27:09
dangerous and irresponsible thing to do
27:12
to a person to suggest that their free
27:13
will is an illusion now this of course
27:16
raises some questions about well
27:19
what's the difference between what
27:21
they're saying and what she said there
27:24
are differences and they're important
27:26
differences but in the meantime we have
27:28
a lot of cognitive scientists and
27:31
neuroscientists and philosophers going
27:33
around saying neuroscience shows that
27:37
nobody has free will
27:39
nonsense it shows no such thing and it's
27:43
very important that we stop that
27:46
bandwagon before it builds up a head of
27:49
steam or it will start doing some real
27:52
damage there is by the way empirical
27:55
evidence that people who have been told
27:59
this message become more irresponsible
28:03
vos and schooler Jonathan schooler out
28:06
at the University of California Santa
28:08
Barbara did a very clever experiment
28:09
where they had subject undergraduate
28:13
students as usual but in two groups one
28:18
group was given a passage from Francis
28:20
Crick's book the astonishing hypothesis
28:22
Oh which talked about consciousness the
28:25
other group was given another passage
28:27
from the same book by Nobel laureate
28:29
Francis Crick which says free will is an
28:32
illusion both groups of students are
28:38
then given a test or it's a puzzle to
28:43
solve and they're going to get paid for
28:44
how well they do in the puzzle and
28:48
deliberately the experimenters have made
28:51
it possible to cheat on this test and
28:54
the students who saw who read the
28:57
passage where Crick says that they don't
29:00
have any free will they cheated
29:02
significantly more than the students who
29:05
read the other passage and that study
29:07
has been replicated so this is a this is
29:09
a real this is not just a fantasy of
29:11
philosophers but now you think what
29:15
still doesn't don't we learn from brain
29:18
science that since brains are more or
29:21
less determined and what's going on and
29:24
then probably doesn't owe anything to
29:26
quantum effects in the brain doesn't
29:28
that show we don't have free will it
29:30
well let's see I want to
29:32
ask you whether you think the fall which
29:36
of the two lotteries are fair in lottery
29:38
a the winning ticket is chosen after the
29:44
tickets are sold that's most lotteries
29:47
are like that you buy a ticket then they
29:49
make have a ceremony where they choose
29:51
the winning ticket lottery B is just the
29:54
same except the winning ticket is chosen
29:56
before the tickets are sold and the
29:59
ticket stub is locked away in a vault
30:01
until after the tickets are sold now how
30:04
many of you think that lottery B is
30:08
unfair that that you don't really have a
30:10
chance of winning lottery B that lottery
30:13
a may be fair but lottery B is is just
30:16
some kind of a hoax how many of you
30:17
think that hardly anybody I think I
30:22
think the audience is right they are
30:24
eeeek there's they're equally good both
30:26
of them both of you have no and after
30:29
all Publishers Clearing House bets on
30:31
this they sent you send out those
30:33
envelopes you may already have one you
30:35
know a million dollars or whatever
30:37
people see that both of these are fair
30:40
lotteries with opportunities to win in
30:44
both cases but now look if determinism
30:47
is true then you're all your lottery
30:48
tickets were chosen before you were born
30:50
and put in an envelope for you to use as
30:54
you needed a coin flip as you needed a
30:56
little bit of luck right so what people
31:05
say well you know then you're determined
31:09
to have good luck on some occasions and
31:11
had luck on others yeah but that's true
31:13
even if in determinism is true there's
31:17
no difference between in determinism and
31:20
determinism as far as you're having
31:22
opportunities in this life so we should
31:27
temper our conviction very traditional
31:32
conviction that there's a deep
31:33
incompatibility between determinism and
31:36
free will and moral responsibility it
31:40
just isn't there it takes a lot of
31:42
intuition pumps to get people to see
31:44
that but
31:44
is one okay the philosopher David
31:49
Wiggins once said many years ago talking
31:52
about this issue you talked about the
31:54
cosmic unfairness of determinism and I
31:59
think a lot of you say yeah I know what
32:01
he means yeah
32:02
cosmic unfairness of determinism yeah
32:04
well what about the cosmic unfairness of
32:06
in determinism they are equal on this
32:11
score you're going to win some you're
32:14
going to lose some the luck average is
32:17
out in most cases not perfectly that's
32:19
life you can't get around that in
32:22
determinism doesn't give you any more
32:24
luck
32:24
any more opportunities any more free
32:26
will anymore elbowroom
32:28
than you would have in a deterministic
32:30
world I dare say I haven't persuaded
32:35
many of you of that but give me time I'm
32:39
working on it okay so there they are the
32:42
book is sort of like at APIs in a 77
32:46
thinking tools 77 little chapters and
32:49
the point of the term intuition pump is
32:53
that you're encouraged to think of these
32:55
as gadgets as devices you should take
32:58
them apart see how they work
33:00
reverse-engineer them turn all the knobs
33:05
see why they do what they do then you
33:09
can build your own thanks for coming
33:26
so now questions we have microphones yes
33:30
um earlier on you mentioned Chinese room
33:34
scenario as a thinking pump that's like
33:37
a sort of bass one I was wondering if
33:39
you go into more detail about that haha
33:42
I'm going to decline for it but I'm
33:45
going to explain why I'm going to
33:47
decline John Searles chinese room has
33:55
been amazingly successful as a persuader
33:58
for now over 30 years and I have spent
34:02
many hours every year in the last 30
34:06
trying to explain to people why it is
34:09
not a good intuition pump
34:11
why it is defective and I've learned
34:15
several things from this one of them is
34:18
that if you don't understand how
34:21
computers really do their work you don't
34:23
get it
34:26
Searle is rudely dismissive of what he
34:30
calls the system's reply but anybody who
34:33
understands computers knows that the
34:35
system reply is just obviously right so
34:39
you have to you have to take you have to
34:41
read the chapter you have to become
34:43
computer literate in this rather strong
34:45
way to understand why Searles thought
34:50
experiment is defective in fact I teach
34:55
my students at Tufts how to program
34:57
register machines in my regular
35:00
undergraduate course on language in mind
35:02
this is I say this is just a thinking
35:04
tool that you should have later in the
35:08
course end of the course they get to
35:10
read Searle and they all see right
35:12
through it but it would take me too long
35:16
to lead you through all those exercises
35:18
that's why you have to buy the book
35:22
but I want to add something to that too
35:24
I notice what I try to explain this to a
35:30
lot of people girls what's wrong with
35:34
girl their eyes glaze over and I realize
35:38
that if I prod them a little bit I know
35:41
why they hate the idea that artificial
35:44
intelligence is possible they love the
35:48
fact that a Berkeley professor has an
35:51
argument which has as its conclusion
35:54
that strong AI is impossible and that
35:57
suits them just fine they don't want to
36:01
hear the details they like the
36:03
conclusion don't bother me with the
36:05
details it looks to them like nitpicking
36:08
well I used to hold that attitude in
36:14
contempt I thought this was this is the
36:16
worst sort of anti intellectual attitude
36:19
and then I caught myself doing it on a
36:22
related issue or know a different issue
36:24
I will confess that I find the
36:29
Copenhagen interpretation of quantum
36:31
mechanics ugly offensive I just don't
36:37
want it to be true and I don't want it
36:40
to be accepted and I know a lot of
36:44
people share that attitude with me but
36:46
never mind that's not the point
36:48
my what I've always felt oppressed by
36:52
the Copenhagen interpretation and
36:54
thought gosh I hope I just don't want
36:57
that to be right and then Murray
37:00
gell-mann Nobel laureate in physics in
37:05
his book the quark and the Jaguar takes
37:09
off after the Copenhagen interpretation
37:12
and he just beats the tar out of it he
37:16
is just hit em again Murray and the
37:20
chapter called Quantum flapdoodle he
37:26
no-holds-barred he just lets the quantum
37:30
interpretation have it between
37:32
right both barrels right between the
37:34
eyes and I found myself reading that
37:36
proof
37:37
hit him again Mary I love this I love
37:39
this and then I realized I'm not
37:41
qualified to judge Murray gell-mann
37:46
argument maybe I'm just being taken in
37:48
by the rhetoric and the fact that he's
37:50
got a Nobel Prize I'm so pleased that
37:53
there's a Nobel laureate who's on my
37:55
side and that's the way people feel a
37:59
lot of them about Searle that's why it's
38:02
an uphill battle a lot of people want
38:03
Searle to be right they are offended by
38:06
the idea of artificial intelligence and
38:08
they don't want to listen to some
38:10
nitpicker who says the argument doesn't
38:12
work so I've come to temper my view I
38:16
realize that there can be deep aesthetic
38:19
and emotional antipathies to a certain
38:22
view which can get in the way of a
38:25
patient consideration of the arguments
38:28
so you see I've mellowed
38:33
but I've also explained to you at great
38:35
length why I'm not going to talk about
38:37
the Chinese rule I profess it in it and
38:45
I come up here okay upstairs upstairs
38:49
hello and I agree with you about the
38:51
systems reply so I suppose they need to
38:53
buy the book or anything and do you
38:55
think that the the logical endpoint of
38:58
our thinking tools is the what some
39:02
people call whole brain emulation of the
39:04
uploading of the human mind to an
39:07
artificial system where we can have
39:10
tools far beyond our current imagining
39:12
do you think it's possible I think it's
39:15
possible in principle very unlikely in
39:17
fact there's lots of things that are
39:19
possible in principle that would be
39:24
nevertheless technologically unrealistic
39:27
my favorite example is would it be
39:32
possible to build a robotic bird that
39:36
could perch on a twig and catch insects
39:38
on the fly and way you know a few
39:43
hundred grams
39:45
yeah possible in principle don't expect
39:50
it I say that knowing that some of my
39:56
robotics friends are developing little
39:58
robotic insects with cameras on them
40:01
that can sort of be the fly on the wall
40:04
so we're getting closer but still I
40:08
think the sort of adroitness of an
40:11
insect averse bird will probably evade
40:17
technology indefinitely and there's no
40:22
real reason to do it and I think the
40:24
same thing is true about sort of whole
40:26
brain emulation you've got I've recently
40:31
by the way sort of changed my mind about
40:33
about the brain as a computer as I told
40:35
I said in your neck top I do think your
40:38
brain is a computer it's not at all like
40:41
your laptop well it is it is because
40:43
it's a computer but the organization and
40:48
the construction of the cerebral
40:53
computer has some fundamental
40:55
differences from any device that we've
40:58
built so far out of silicon for one
41:01
thing in a computer every memory place
41:06
every flip flop every logic it they're
41:11
all exactly alike write down practically
41:15
to the atoms and the reliability of the
41:18
system depends on that tremendous
41:21
uniformity it's a it's a masterpiece of
41:25
precision engineering your brain has
41:29
somewhere between say 100 and 200
41:31
billion neurons no two are alike and
41:36
they have their own agendas they're not
41:41
as slavish as the flip flops in the
41:44
machine
41:45
they are computing there are a whole
41:50
bunch of slightly willful selfish
41:54
interacting slaves and they do can
41:57
cute but not really the way your laptop
42:01
computes so I think the task of
42:03
emulating all of that in silicon is
42:08
possible in principle but really
42:12
unlikely after all not only do you have
42:16
some hundreds of billions of neurons
42:19
you've got ten times more astrocytes
42:22
glial cells in your brain and although
42:25
we used to think of them as sort of
42:26
little pillows that just protected the
42:28
neurons no no no turns out they're
42:30
computing - so the brain we now realize
42:33
is orders of magnitude more complicated
42:36
than we thought just a few years ago so
42:38
don't hold your breath thanks who's that
42:46
the mic okay here and then there
42:53
go ahead given the natural and acquired
42:59
deficiencies and limitations for minds
43:02
where do you see the greatest dangers in
43:06
the way we make decisions and what is
43:10
the change or what are the changes that
43:12
need to happen
43:13
oh that's very good and because it
43:20
permits me to to illustrate one of my
43:23
main themes many of the thinking tools
43:26
that we've developed over the centuries
43:28
have been designed as prosthetic
43:32
improvements on our natural equipment
43:35
which is really faulty as we've
43:36
discovered we're lousy for instance of
43:39
probability naturally we're as George
43:44
Angley points out we are exponential
43:46
discounters of future events and that's
43:49
just wrong it's a fallacy but Nature has
43:53
built us that way we have lots of
43:55
foibles little cognitive glitches and a
43:59
lot of people who pointed them out in
44:01
recent years Danny Kahneman and Amos
44:03
Tversky in a famous series of papers and
44:06
now more recently Danny's got the book
44:08
out on Thinking Fast and Slow
44:10
but the point is that we can think slow
44:12
and when we think slow using words tools
44:17
and using the methods that we've devised
44:19
we can overcome the natural limitations
44:25
of our brains and we can become to put
44:29
it bluntly more civilized and more
44:32
rational and the vert crack that you
44:35
asked the question in a little recursive
44:38
loop shows that we can be indefinitely
44:42
self-critical and critical of what we're
44:44
doing so far as as we discover problems
44:48
in collective irrationality we can start
44:52
devising solutions or workarounds for
44:55
those problems I think we can I don't
44:59
see any thing like you know a sound
45:03
barrier or a brick wall that will
45:05
prevent us from continuing to transcend
45:10
our current cognitive limits with
45:12
further limits I don't see any any
45:15
natural stopping point to that I'm sure
45:17
there will always be things we'll never
45:19
understand but that doesn't impress me
45:24
because never is a long way away
45:28
and the things that matter to us I see
45:31
no reason why we can't understand them
45:35
now where somebody on yeah yeah maybe
45:40
here okay good yeah I struggled with
45:43
your talk I was intrigued by the problem
45:48
you sat at the beginning which said that
45:51
IQ has increased and I struggled because
45:55
what I heard afterwards was a long list
45:57
of thinking tools but what I didn't hear
46:00
was statistical or measurable analysis
46:04
of what caused that change or how it
46:06
could be demonstrated last week there
46:09
was an article in The Times newspaper
46:10
that said that thinking speeds have
46:13
decreased significantly since the
46:15
Victorian times thinking skills speeds
46:18
average thinking speeds have disagreed
46:21
feeds young
46:23
that the speed people take to come to a
46:26
certain decision or work something out
46:27
has actually slowed down another example
46:31
in the UK some people might not agree
46:33
with me but many people think that
46:36
educational standards particularly at
46:39
secondary school have been dumbed down
46:40
significantly universities certainly
46:43
complain about that a lot and so
46:46
wouldn't one see actually a decrease in
46:49
IQ in certain advanced countries because
46:53
of that so can you give any examples of
46:55
how people have statistically or
46:57
scientifically measured and what
47:00
actually increases IQ what decreases it
47:03
yeah Jim Flynn and many others have done
47:08
a lot of statistical research and have
47:10
explored various hypotheses and it's not
47:13
diet and it's not wealth and it's
47:15
worldwide and the results seem to be
47:20
quite robust and culture independent and
47:22
I mean I can't I can't cite chapter and
47:26
verse I except to say just just google
47:29
it and thinking of talking about
47:31
thinking to Google James Flynn and the
47:34
Flynn effect and you will find a feast
47:38
of online materials to peruse now I I'm
47:43
interested in this Times reported study
47:46
of slowed down thinking and I I want to
47:50
see what's involved one possibility of
47:52
course is that by slowing down people
47:55
are thinking better of just taking a
47:57
little more time because their tools
47:59
take a little more time to work after
48:01
all one of the messages of Danny
48:03
Kahneman's book Thinking Fast and Slow
48:04
is there are things that Thinking Fast
48:06
is good at and then there are things
48:08
that you better think slow or you won't
48:10
get it right and it might be that we've
48:13
shifted the balance since Victorian days
48:16
whether whether this is a part of the
48:21
increase in general capacity to not make
48:24
mistakes or whether it's a decrease I
48:26
don't know but it's an interesting
48:27
question it might well be that it pays
48:31
to slow down on some of these tasks and
48:34
that's something we've learned
48:36
I'll look into that yes I'm sorry this
48:43
is moving too far away okay yeah there
48:46
you go okay
48:47
moving too far away from topic but I'm
48:48
really interested to you to you here
48:51
what do you think victim Stein would
48:53
make of the four horsemen of atheism
48:58
well I don't know I'm happy to answer
49:01
the question now lo I don't think when I
49:06
was a student I was a very great
49:11
appreciator of the later Wittgenstein
49:13
along with my fellow Oxford students
49:15
although I did not think of him as the
49:19
sort of intellectual Saint that they did
49:22
and in fact I found a lot of Vidkun
49:25
Stein's later work to be suspiciously
49:31
mysterious and I I fled that it's
49:39
interesting you know he had some
49:41
training as an engineer and I've met
49:44
other engineers who at a certain point
49:46
in their life suddenly take a swan dive
49:49
into philosophy and it's usually
49:54
disastrous Viktor Stein clearly wasn't
50:00
that kind of thinker he was I think
50:03
himself a great constructor of intuition
50:06
pumps what he would make of the of the
50:09
Four Horsemen of atheism I I have no
50:13
idea I would expect probably he would
50:21
have a mixed reaction but I won't try to
50:24
untangle it thank you
50:34
yeah this is a non sequitur so feel free
50:37
not to answer but I'm could you think of
50:40
an intuitive way to explain to a
50:43
colorblind person that there's
50:46
information the visual spectrum that
50:48
they're missing out on as a person who's
50:50
not color blind oh sure I think in fact
50:54
my experience with people who are
50:56
colorblind is that they understand color
50:58
fully well they can't pass the Ishihara
51:03
tests but they know what what it's like
51:05
to pass the test as well as something
51:07
after all I think I can explain to you
51:10
what it's like to be a pigeon who's a
51:12
Tetra Chrome instead of a tri-chromatic
51:15
vision and and and and they see more
51:18
colors than we do and things that you
51:21
and I would find indistinguishable in
51:23
color are sharply different to them and
51:26
I we can go into the details I don't
51:31
think this I don't think it's impossible
51:33
to do the hard work of imagining what
51:37
this is like in detail hello hello there
51:47
we are okay the lights are down so low I
51:49
can't really see back there I we've been
51:51
thinking about intuitive tools and I
51:54
just wondered whether you think that
51:57
women are more intuitive than men as
52:00
they often think they are
52:04
oh you're trying to lead me into waters
52:10
where I do not want to go but actually
52:15
I'm glad you asked me the question
52:17
because by intuition pump I sort of
52:20
don't mean that everyday sense of
52:22
intuition I'm talking about intuition
52:26
and the philosopher sense of something
52:28
that occurs to you that you just think
52:30
has got to be right and you're not quite
52:31
sure why I mean it happens all the time
52:35
I remember actually the first pop paper
52:40
I ever published was about artificial
52:42
intelligence and Hubert Dreyfus had
52:45
written his famous alchemy and
52:47
artificial intelligence diatribe against
52:50
AI years before Searle and in that piece
52:55
Dreyfus said that they'd never make a
53:00
computer with intuition that no computer
53:03
program would ever have intuition and in
53:07
my first publication I said actually
53:08
it's child's play to make a computer
53:13
that has intuition you take your
53:16
computer program that solves any problem
53:17
you like it might be long division or
53:19
weather prediction or whatever and you
53:24
ask it a question it gives an answer and
53:26
you say how did you work out that answer
53:29
and it says I don't know it just came to
53:31
me
53:36
intuition is when you've got a
53:38
conviction you haven't the faintest idea
53:40
how you got it when you have an
53:45
intuition pump you and you know that
53:48
before the intuition pump you didn't
53:50
have the idea now you do you can be
53:51
pretty sure that the causation runs
53:53
through that pump somehow now you take
53:55
the pump apart see how it works and you
53:56
get insight into how you arrived at that
53:58
intuition and I'm not going to touch the
54:05
rest of that way yes in the same way
54:13
that we're not quite as good with axes
54:15
as some of our forebears do you think
54:17
that generations get better and worse as
54:20
using thinking tools and if so where do
54:23
you see the future well first of all
54:28
let's let's confirm that people get
54:30
worse how many in this room know how to
54:34
run a slide rule is there anybody under
54:39
40 who knows how to run a slide rule or
54:43
how many of you can actually do the
54:48
algorithm for finding a square root yeah
54:52
but not many use it or lose it
54:57
when you can do it all on your hand
54:59
calculator you don't bother learning the
55:01
technique anymore and you know GPS is
55:05
probably seriously diminishing our
55:08
capacity to read maps wonderful thinking
55:11
tool which is you know becoming more and
55:13
more sort of obsolete and so forth so I
55:18
think that with the times different
55:22
tools play roles of greater or lesser
55:24
importance in what we're doing that will
55:28
no doubt continue and the user to lose
55:30
it
55:31
maksim will I daresay be maintained in
55:39
full force I've always admired and
55:44
envied my British colleagues who were
55:49
required in their youth to memorize lots
55:52
of poetry and I love it I love the way
55:56
they can just find the right line from
55:59
Shakespeare play or a poem and I wish I
56:03
could do that
56:06
I can't of course if I really want to
56:10
get that line I can I can get on the web
56:13
and usually find something appropriate
56:15
pretty fast but it's not the same talent
56:18
they have but after all nobody today
56:21
bothers to memorize train timetables but
56:25
people used to do that as a sort of
56:27
intellectual exercise I would think we
56:30
would find better ways of being
56:32
intellectual athletes then then that and
56:36
our new tools permit us to do that so I
56:40
think we'll go on I think Andy Clark
56:43
wonderful philosopher of cognitive
56:46
science and Edinburgh puts it very well
56:49
when he says that we we we make smart
56:52
tools to take the load off our brain so
56:56
that we can we can be stupid and still
56:58
be sort of smart uh-huh thanks to the
57:01
help we get from our tools and I think
57:04
that's years ago actually let me let me
57:09
expand on that a little bit more years
57:13
ago at tufts george smith my wonderful
57:17
colleague and i created something called
57:19
the curricular software studio and this
57:22
was to bring computers to bear on the
57:27
toughest thinking problems we knew this
57:30
was creating what what we called
57:33
prosthetics of the imagination and one
57:36
of them was it was a simulated computer
57:39
on a computer a 12 bit computer with 256
57:46
registers and but you could watch the
57:48
instruction cycle happen you could you
57:51
could completely see slowed down about a
57:54
million fold and enlarge about a million
57:56
fold what was going on inside the very
57:57
box that it was simulated on that was a
58:00
lovely thinking tool for
58:02
or expanding people's imagination giving
58:04
them a really vivid and reliable robust
58:08
tool for imagining things with computers
58:12
then we did the same thing for
58:14
population genetics and we had a program
58:16
called gene right after Sewell right
58:19
which had this these wonderful
58:20
simulations of population genetics and
58:23
you could you could sort of see at a
58:25
glance
58:25
once you use how to learn how to use
58:27
that tool what was the recessive
58:32
characteristic and why and so forth and
58:34
it was good enough tools so that the the
58:37
evolutionary biologists who helped us
58:39
create it would use it in her own
58:41
research to test her hunches before she
58:44
went to the trouble of seriously
58:46
modeling them and we did other we called
58:52
them concept pianos the reason we called
58:56
them concept pianos was that in my
58:59
eagerness to find other fields where we
59:01
could apply this I talked to a dear
59:03
friend of mine in the music department
59:04
who taught harmony courses and said
59:06
could we could we make a software device
59:09
that would help you teach students
59:11
harmony theory and we sat down and
59:14
brainstormed for a couple of hours and
59:16
realized that what we just invented was
59:18
the piano
59:22
it's wonderful you get the auditory and
59:26
you get two different visualizations you
59:29
get the keyboard and then you've got the
59:31
music in front of you it's it's very
59:34
user friendly you can get it running
59:35
right away but it's indefinitely
59:37
expandable there's really no better
59:40
instrument for learning harmony theory
59:42
than a piano we couldn't really improve
59:44
on it so we but we were making concept
59:46
pianos and other areas and the way we
59:49
used to sort of sell the idea to funders
59:53
and people like that they'd say look
59:54
there's two ways that technology can
59:57
make you smart the same way there's two
60:00
ways that technology can make you strong
60:03
there's the bulldozer way you're still a
60:07
98-pound weakling but in your bulldozer
60:10
you can move mountains and then there's
60:13
the Nautilus machine way you use the
60:16
technology to actually improve your
60:18
muscles in your coordination and so
60:20
forth and we said what we're trying to
60:22
do here is make the Nautilus machines of
60:25
the technology so that they actually you
60:28
walk away with something in your head
60:29
that makes you smarter by expanding by
60:32
giving you these imagination tools
60:34
I think that's we don't want to lose
60:36
sight of the fact that we can use
60:38
technology that way and actually
60:41
increase the imagination powers and the
60:46
adroitness of thinkers an example that
60:49
we started work on this and then for
60:51
various reasons had to abandon it but
60:53
it's still a dream of mine and it's the
60:56
we call it the tube which stands for
61:00
Tufts University brain Explorer but the
61:04
idea was that it would do for the brain
61:06
what the wonderful London Tube map does
61:09
for the underground color-coded
61:12
simplified straighten out the lines
61:14
throw away extra geographical
61:17
information that isn't really important
61:19
so you can see the connectivity and we
61:22
were going to have this lovely big
61:23
three-dimensional color coded system
61:25
that would permit students to see
61:31
what was fastened to what and why in the
61:34
brain and we would update it as we went
61:36
I still think that's a great idea
61:38
and like the to map the idea was you can
61:42
you can take the London to map and you
61:44
can then you can impose it on a map
61:46
which is geographically accurate and you
61:49
can discover things that you can't see
61:51
when you're looking at the map and it's
61:53
regularize simplified idealized form and
61:56
we want to do the same thing with the
61:57
brain when you when you look at the
62:00
thing in its idealized form the cortex
62:04
is all unfolded and it's this great dome
62:07
of a sheet with all this regular all the
62:11
columns and all the layers beautifully
62:13
laid out and you can see it looks like a
62:16
computer then you shrink wrap the whole
62:19
thing to fit in the skull and then you
62:21
can understand why certain things are
62:23
right next to each other in the brain
62:25
even though they're not connected so I
62:28
think that it's possible to use computer
62:32
technology to enhance our imaginations
62:36
not just bypass our imaginations and I'd
62:40
like to see more of that done yeah yep I
62:48
was just curious if you had the
62:51
opportunity right now to upload to the
62:54
rest of humanity one intuition pump and
62:57
only one which one would that be and why
63:00
Oh
63:01
the trouble is that they're for
63:04
different different people in some cases
63:09
the one that I would upload for
63:11
philosophers is one which I published in
63:16
Darwin's dangerous idea and because many
63:19
philosophers do that as you know then
63:22
it's popular book about Darwinism not
63:25
really a philosophy book they didn't
63:28
read it but there's that's the two black
63:30
boxes thought experiment which I think
63:34
just drives a spike through the heart of
63:38
an issue several issues that meta
63:41
physicians have been scratching their
63:43
heads about for
63:44
twenty-five years and we'll see maybe
63:46
second time around they'll pay attention
63:49
to it Thanks you think you can teach a
63:55
humorless person to have a sense of
63:57
humor
64:03
no probably not
64:10
in consciousness explained at one point
64:15
I sort of promised to come up with a
64:16
theory of humor and laughter and then I
64:20
couldn't and I sort of wished I could
64:22
erase that sentence because I couldn't
64:24
keep that promise and then in some few
64:27
years ago a student showed up Matthew
64:29
Hurley he wanted to do a theory of humor
64:32
with me and at first I thought his
64:35
theory was hopeless didn't like it at
64:37
all
64:37
but he gradually convinced me of it and
64:39
we did that book together with reg Adams
64:42
inside jokes using humor to
64:44
reverse-engineer the mind and I'm really
64:46
glad that I did that because I learned a
64:49
ton and I'm really proud of the theory
64:51
it's the Hurley model it's not mine in
64:53
the first place although I've tweaked it
64:55
a good deal but uh among other things
65:00
that explains is sort of why you can't
65:03
have an algorithm for being humorous
65:06
even though we argue it's the brain as a
65:09
computer and and we want it is a
65:12
computational it's an evolutionary
65:14
computational model of humor but it it's
65:18
not an algorithm for funny and we don't
65:21
think there is one and we say why the
65:29
one of the ways we did the research on
65:32
that is actually to spend some time not
65:37
only reading the worst but talking with
65:38
comedians and comedy writers to find out
65:42
sort of how they how they go about their
65:44
trade and how they use their own brains
65:47
as sounding boards and then their brains
65:50
get sort of distorted and it's they
65:54
can't clear their palate in effect they
65:55
can't they can't find the touch because
66:00
they've used it too much in certain ways
66:05
it's that's that among other reasons is
66:09
why I think humor it will always be sort
66:11
of an art not a not a science but that
66:15
doesn't mean there isn't the science of
66:16
why it's an art
66:22
somewhere here hi we run a
66:31
decision-making company we help teams
66:33
think through complex problems and I was
66:35
really struck by your comment that all
66:39
serious thinking is interpersonal which
66:42
will run counter to what we hear a lot
66:45
every day or the resistance we face I'm
66:46
just interesting to know what leads you
66:48
to that conclusion well many things do
66:55
one of them is a very recent paper in
66:58
behavioural brain sciences by Hugo
67:00
Mercier and dance / bear on the flaws in
67:06
our reasoning and they argue that as
67:10
part of our evolutionary heritage we're
67:13
better at detecting the flaws and an
67:15
opponent than in our own case where we
67:19
just are constitutionally bad at
67:24
gritting our teeth and looking for
67:27
errors in what we believe and our
67:30
reasons for it but we're very good at
67:33
ferreting out the errors in what the
67:36
other side believes well if that's true
67:39
and they make a good case for it then as
67:43
just about everywhere else in nature the
67:46
way to do this is with an opponent
67:48
process our eyes work with an opponent
67:52
process in several ways first of all the
67:55
muscles that determine where your eye
67:57
looks next those are sort of in a
68:00
constant tug-of-war with each other
68:01
pulling this way that but that's a very
68:03
sort of friendly tug-of-war but then in
68:06
the frontal eye fields we've got this
68:08
other opponent process going on
68:10
where there are little teams of neurons
68:13
that are saying about wherever fixation
68:16
is some of them are saying home sweet
68:18
home nice I like this familiar and the
68:21
others are saying boring been there done
68:24
that they want to move and this is
68:26
constant opponent process between
68:28
different groups
68:29
neurons transit look over here no look
68:31
where we're looking and and they they
68:33
Duke it out constantly all day long and
68:36
the result is that you have very good
68:39
patterns of eye tracking because in the
68:43
opponent processes among the little
68:46
groups they get the job done very well
68:49
unless you've got a problem and if
68:52
you've got a deficiency there then you
68:54
get abnormal saccadic and if you have
68:58
abnormal sick adding that means you're
69:00
not looking where you should be looking
69:01
when you should be looking and that is a
69:04
profound deficit there's strong evidence
69:08
for instance that autistic children do
69:11
not have normal saccadic they don't look
69:14
where they should they're not good at
69:15
gaze monitoring their mothers and and
69:19
they don't they're not good at at joint
69:23
attention and this means that whereas a
69:28
normal infant is just sucking from a
69:35
firehose of information all the time
69:39
some are not sort of attending to the
69:42
right place at the right time and it
69:44
changes the way their whole brain works
69:46
sometimes for the better sometimes for
69:48
the worst so I think opponent processes
69:51
our Nature's Way of getting jobs done
69:55
very often and we should just
69:58
acknowledge that and exploit it and
70:00
refine it for whatever it is what we're
70:02
trying to do I was fascinated where your
70:08
approach on freewill and I don't know
70:10
about anybody else here but remember
70:13
we're coming into into into touch with
70:15
the idea the kind of sexy rebellious
70:18
idea that the free will is an illusion
70:20
it seemed to gel with it I think what I
70:22
love
70:23
people were intuiting surely about kind
70:28
of non-religious heading towards a more
70:30
material explanation of things that's
70:32
very leftist to think anti free will but
70:34
you argue very powerfully Pro free will
70:38
and so I just wanted to find out what if
70:40
you could explain when
70:42
the neuroscience sources are that
70:44
explained materially where free will
70:47
occurs and when it occurred and also and
70:51
also if we want to debate whether it
70:54
exists or not where you want to see the
70:57
debate moving on you know there's a lot
70:58
of mm sociologists who want us to be
71:01
talking about freewill purely because
71:04
they want to they want to say that look
71:05
there's a certain class of people who
71:06
are populating our prisons politicians
71:11
mainly in this country but where yeah
71:14
where would you like to see that debate
71:15
go what's it's useful application and
71:17
and and yet in the neuroscience thank
71:19
you there's a lot in that but and I
71:23
appreciate all of it actually and I've
71:26
been thinking and talking a lot about
71:29
what prison reforms we might want to do
71:32
and what whether the system of
71:34
punishment needs any revision some of
71:36
you may have seen the review I did of
71:39
Adrian Raines wonderful book in Prospect
71:41
last month
71:42
Adrian reign is the neuroscientist
71:45
psychologist who's studied the brains of
71:49
psychopaths on death row
71:52
murderers a lot of them and even more
71:55
amazing as the experiments he did where
71:58
he got a lot of of psychopaths in the
72:00
wild that is they'd never been in any
72:04
trouble with the law well how do you how
72:07
do you find psychopaths in the wild he
72:11
had a hunch he got a grant he hired
72:15
dozens of temp workers in Los Angeles
72:18
and found that sure enough when he gave
72:21
them all the tests that are used in the
72:23
prisons for psychopathy so it's the sort
72:26
of gold standard measure the there were
72:31
psychopaths among the temps at a rate
72:33
about three times the the average in the
72:36
regular population so now we had a group
72:39
of psychopaths that had never been in
72:42
prison had any trouble of law and under
72:45
the certificate of confidentiality that
72:49
his work was done he was able to get his
72:52
graduate assistants to interview these
72:54
in depth
72:55
and they all confessed to armed
72:58
robberies rapes even murders so they
73:04
really are psychopaths and they're
73:05
really out there and and he's got the
73:07
tools to study them psychopaths are
73:10
different there but there's other people
73:11
with other sorts of brain differences
73:14
that we have to treat differently in our
73:17
in our system of law and punishment I
73:20
don't agree with all of reigns
73:24
proposals I don't think he does either
73:26
by the way but it's he's raised the
73:29
issue very well and it was called the
73:30
anatomy of violence but in my own work
73:36
what I want to do is turn the tables a
73:41
little bit and say instead of looking at
73:45
the metaphysical foundations of free
73:47
will and whether or not quantum
73:49
indeterminacy plays a role work
73:51
backwards start with the idea of the
73:55
free agent as being morally competent
74:00
being a morally competent agent and ask
74:04
yourself what are the specs for a
74:06
morally competent agent what does it
74:08
have to have in it what does it what
74:11
should you be able to do to be morally
74:13
competent and we can work that out I
74:15
think quite well and it turns out that
74:17
neuroscience has next to nothing to say
74:19
about about how normal people might not
74:22
be morally competent I think normal
74:24
people are morally competent and hence
74:26
in that sense have free will and because
74:29
they have free will they are proper and
74:33
because they're morally competent they
74:35
are appropriate bearers of full
74:39
responsibility for their deeds and this
74:42
includes their eligibility for
74:45
punishment when they commit misdeeds
74:50
that's a long story but I think that's a
74:53
constructive way of proceeding most of
74:58
us I daresay everybody in this room
75:00
believes they have free will in this
75:02
sense if you believe that you are
75:05
competent enough to sign a contract
75:07
binding contract then then you have
75:10
freewill in this sense I mean then you
75:13
believe you have freewill
75:14
in this sense has nothing to do with
75:16
determinism or in determinism it has to
75:19
do with your ability to assess outcomes
75:25
probabilities consequences costs and
75:30
benefits the value of reputation and so
75:34
forth if you've got all of that then
75:36
when you sign a contract you mean it and
75:38
so it counts anybody else yet one more
75:51
up top
75:52
yes let's go thank you for your
75:56
presentation I have a question with
75:59
regards to the connection between the
76:02
physical part of our brain how this is
76:04
impacted in our networked and
76:08
computerized communication as we move on
76:11
more and more into online networking and
76:14
communication and how this will impact
76:16
our history of philosophy going forward
76:18
so you know what would our thinking be
76:21
different let's say compared to the
76:23
Greeks and how this will be changing and
76:26
what we need to be thinking about oh I
76:28
think the answer is yes it's very clear
76:31
that our thinking today is different
76:33
from the ancient Greeks because as small
76:36
children we can master all sorts of
76:39
concepts but not the smartest people in
76:42
Athens couldn't master not just about
76:48
science but certainly about science I
76:50
think we have a hugely enlarged
76:55
conceptual repertory today compared with
76:58
the ancient Greeks that doesn't mean
77:01
that they weren't wise but I think it
77:04
does does mean that it was harder for
77:06
them to work these things out and if you
77:08
look at Plato's dialogues for instance
77:12
at least to my eyes often what I see
77:16
there strikes me as who
77:19
growing heroic attempts to think about
77:24
topics that Plato and his interlocutors
77:28
don't have the terms for and they're
77:30
sort of inventing distinctions in terms
77:34
as they go along and sometimes making
77:36
rather embarrassing mistakes by today's
77:39
standards I had the same impression when
77:45
I went back some years ago and read the
77:47
books that were my favorite books when I
77:51
was a graduate student in Oxford first
77:54
learning about the brain and trying to
77:55
think about the mind as the brain and
77:57
there wasn't very much that was written
77:59
it was good what was good was in its way
78:01
brilliant but they just didn't have the
78:03
tools they didn't have the thinking
78:05
tools the expression tools that we have
78:07
today and they labored brilliantly and
78:11
eccentrically and ingeniously to explain
78:14
things that now I think that the average
78:19
smart 14 year old could put quite aptly
78:24
in a few simple sentences of cyber
78:27
speech thanks I think that's a good
78:32
point on which to stop thank you
78:41
you
