Red multplied by blue makes the purple output variable.
Of course you add the intercept to this regression value so that it bumps up the prediction to the appropriate range.

A 2007 study found that internists who refreshed their stethoscope skills by using a smartphone app were able to double their accuracy. The doctors who listened to 400 clips of 5 different heart murmurs were able to then correctly classify real heart murmurs with 80% accuracy, vs 40% for the control group.

Clinical medical records full of unstructured data in a variety of formats. Summarizing these records brings together deep learning algorithms for NLP and computer vision. An obvious application is to use NLP to and summarize text notes by doctors and nurses. Interestingly machines are also being taught to read the reports generated by other machines such as those tables of blood test and genetic test results included in your medical record. Over time EHR systems will standardize on more and more data formats for the various tabular data generated by the machines assisting us with medical tests and procedures. Only recently has deep learning technology advanced to the point that machines can start to reduce the burdon on doctors. Doctors are the first ones to benefit from systems that allow them to summarize clinical medical records accurately. This helps doctors focus on the most relevant information in the long history of symptoms and treatments cataloged in a clinical medical record. In the US most of the deep learning and AI applications in healthcare center around insurance companies. Adjudication is the process by which health insurers aprove or deny claims and coverage requests. When you file a medical health insurance claim or obtain treatment at a hospital, that begins a long paper trail of documentation and bills. Your clinical medical record is updated and the insurer then reviews the bill from the provider. They can <em>disposition</em> the claim, request additional information. Health Insurance companies are required to pay for outside entities to review insurance claims to validate their disposition. These outside entities hire doctors to review clinical medical records and the dispositionare leading the way in employing deep learning and AI to improve docto
