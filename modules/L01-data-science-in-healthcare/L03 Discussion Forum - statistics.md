# L03 Discussion Forum - statistics

What statistics have you seen in the news lately for healthcare issues? If you can't think of any do some googling for articles on the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak, or the recent studies refuting the evidence (statistics) on the negative impact of running on osteoarthritis, or any other healthcare topic where statistical evidence was used to draw a conclusion.

1. Were these statistics accurate?

2. Did you notice any logical fallacies or misinterpretation of statistics?

3. Did you notice any unaccounted variables or "back door" confounding variables? Think about all the variables that were unmeasured and might contribute to the outcome cited in the article.

4. Do you notice mention of any spurious correlations or correlations in general? This one will be harder, but look for any wording such as "x is related to y". This could be a real causal relationship or a spurious correlation, depending on the scientists interpretation of the data and other evidence.

5. Did you notice any counterintuitive insights that surprised you? Most articles are trying to surprise you. So think about why you clicked on the link and whether the relationship between variables/statistics in the article surprised you, and why. Think about your "prior" your estimate of the relationship probabilities before reading the article and how after reading the article you updated your "prior" beliefs to create "posterior" beliefs about relationships between variables in the world.
