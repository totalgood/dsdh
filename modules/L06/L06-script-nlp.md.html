<aside class="notes">
<p>The goal of Natural Language Processing to compile natural langauge text into a numerical representation that captures its meaning. To do this we need to break text into chunks that are meaningful so taht we can give them a numerical representation. So the first thing you’ll learn is what those chunks of meaning are. Then you’ll learn some meaningful numerical representations of those chunks. One of the most popular and useful representations is called a word vector. You’ll see some example uses for these word vectors and some of the challenges and the majic of these high dimensional word vectors.</p>
<p>Then you will see how to use vector representations of natural language text for machine leanring and semantic search. You may have heard of IBM Watson being used for medical diagnosis support. You will learn about this cognitive search application of natural language processing.</p>
<p>Finally you will learn about conversational AI or chatbots and how they are used in healthcare. Conversational AI is particularly useful in underdeveloped healthcare systems such as in India, South America, and Africa.</p>

<p>If you study the psychological processes involved when you read or write or speak natural language, then your courses and graduate studies will likely be in the Psychology or Neuroscience department.</p>

<p>If you study the engineering of NLP systems most of your classes will be in a computer science department and you will think of your job as kind of like building compilers for natural language.</p>
<p>If you study the grammars that are useful of NLP your classes will be in the mathematics department and you will think of your job as designing formal logic grammars and using those to generate formal logical proofs of theorems in natural language.</p>

Hopefully I will be able to infect you with my fascination for the magic of machines that can interact with us in our own language so well that we can hardly tell they are not human. It’s scary and inspiring at the same time.</p>

<img src="media/uncanny_valley.png" alt="" /><figcaption>Mashiro Mori’s Uncanny Valley diagram. This shows user satisfaction with humanoid robotics technology on teh vertical axis. The horizontal axis shows the advancement of technology and time. More advanced technologies are shown on the right of the plot. As technology advances from left to right there is a gradual increase in satisfaction with technology until it reaches the lip of the uncanny valley and user satisfaction drops while anxiety increases, due to the creepiness of some advanced robotic systems. to the right of this dip, customer satisfaction climbs again as technology advances and we forget that the machine is not a human.</figcaption>

<p>Diagram alt text: …</p>
<p>Let’s explore deep into the uncanny valley together.</p>
<p>The diagram here was sketched by Mashiro Mori in 1970, just as personal computers were being developed and systems like conversational AI programs like ELIZA were becoming popular.</p>
<p>Systems that look like a human body, but don’t act like them probably trigger an emotional response similar to what you experience when you see a dead body (corpse) or see a zombie movie. We have probably evolved to detect the subtle behavioral cues of sickness or mental illness. This same discomfort with humanoid robots can also sometimes be triggered by chatbots, estpecially if the bot is given a voice that sounds relatively human. See if you can sense your own creepiness as you have a conversation with Alexa or Google Assistant. Those engineers have worked very hard to ensure that you don’t get creeped out. This isn’t the creepiness you feel when it seems like the bot anticipates your actions before you even know you are going to do something. This is the creepiness of hearing some subtle cues in the voice that is unnatural, while at the same time imagining that it is a human mind at work.</p>
