## Thinking While Drinking Group Agreement:

We are a community that values diversity of thought, learning from our differences, and compassionate conversation. Based on these values we expect the following:
Listen to learn, not to perfect your speech.
Speak from your personal perspective.
Be aware of the space you’re taking in the conversation by not speaking over each other and leave room for all to share.

If you are found unable to meet these expectations, you will be asked to leave the group.

## Summary

The habits, eccentricities, and social norms in dive bars are as varied as the bars themselves. You never know who you’re going to meet, or what you’re going to learn.

## Themes

10.5 Life Lessons: be kind to everyone; you’re never too old to make new friends; the camera never lies; those we love never really go away; recess isn’t just for kids; cash is king; the soundtrack of life should be unexpected; there’s always room for Jell-O; keep Christmas in your heart all year long; there’s joy and delight from the unexpected surprises in life; it’s not a small world, it’s a big bar, and strangers are just friends you haven’t had a drink with yet;

## Potential Questions:

- What do you regard as some of the qualities of a dive bar? What do you look for in a dive bar? What do you look for in a bar or social venue?
- What are some life lessons you’ve learned from dive bars and their patrons?
- Are there other institutions that mix people from various backgrounds as effectively or efficiently as a dive bar?
- Is there a better place to procrastinate and distract yourself than at a dive bar?
- Is there an alternative to dive bars that are less alcohol-centric but can serve the same purpose as dive bars?

## Potential Round Robin Questions:

- Do you have a favorite dive bar?  What do you enjoy about it?
- Are you familiar with any of the dive bars mentioned in the video?
- Any stories of an interesting experience at a dive bar?
- What is your favorite dive bar in San Diego? Elsewhere?
