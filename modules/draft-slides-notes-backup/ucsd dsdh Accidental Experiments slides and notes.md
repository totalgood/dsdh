# Accidental Experiment

::: notes

Accidental experiments, call "natural experiments" by economists, are the subject of _Freakonomics_ and _Superfreakonomics_ by Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner.

In one chapter they tell the story of a catalog retailer and their snail mail marketing campaign.
One month, a forgetful employee neglected to send out their mail to a large portion of their market.
Fortunately for the employee this ended well.
Levitt was able to detect glean an unexpected insight from this accidental experiment. revealed something none of the executives and statisticians would ever have believed otherwise.
The direct mail campaign was actually hurting their sales.
They made more money off the regions in Chicago where their direct mail campain skipped than the ones where the catalogs had been delivered.
