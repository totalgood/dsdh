<li>Both RCTs and natural experiments occur in both the “real world” and laboratory settings﻿. The main difference is that in an RCT the conditions are determined beforehand based on the goals of the research. Also subjects are randomly selected to ensure they are representative of the population. This ensures the test subjects represent the exogenous variables (unmeasured and not being studied) all affect the outcome variable with the same influence they would have among that population in the future. This limits the minimum number of variables that must be monitored to the treatment variables and the outcome variables. In a natural experiment, the experiment wasn’t designed or manipulated beforehand. This means that subjects were not randomly selected and assigned to control and test groups. Also the environment the subjects are exposed to is not controled because the experiement was not designed before the data occurred. Historical data is analyzed after the events of interest have already occurred. This means that exogenous variables must be minimized or placeholder “unknown influence” variables must be created in order to create an accurate causal model.</li>

<p>1a. RCTs are randomized and the environment can be controlled. RCTs are less susceptible to selection bias and exogenous confounding influences on the subjects. The variables are controlled and and a comparator (the placebo or control group) to establish a treatment affect and create a causal model without the need to measure and account for confounding variables, including unknown exogenous variables.</p>
