<p>I hope you’re as excited as I am to explore all the ways that Data Science can be used to advance health care, improve outcomes, and even save lives!</p>
<p>This course has been crafted by experts with deep experience in applying data science to health care. And because this field is evolving so rapidly, we prepared this material in an <em>agile</em>, just in time fashion. And you will be able to contribute your ideas and experiences during this course to help us improve it and keep it up to date.</p>
<p>Don’t worry if you’ve never used statistics to predict the future or if you’ve never trained a machine learning model using a programming language like python. We’ll show you how to use whatever tools you are familiar with to take advantage of all the amazing developments in Data Science. You can use a spreadsheet program like Libre Office, Google Sheets, or Excel. And once you are ready to automate your work, you’ll soon learn how to use the python programming language and open source tools to go even further. By the end of the course you’ll be able to implement state of the art Data Science models. You will come away from this course with an ability to teach machines how to find patterns in data. And you will learn new things yourself about medicine and health care from those patterns.</p>
