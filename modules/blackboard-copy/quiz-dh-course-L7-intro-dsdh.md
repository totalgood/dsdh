# Quiz: DH Lecture 7 -- Introduction to Data Science

Q1: "Regarding the public health studies of smoking in the 60's, which of the following is **NOT** true:
    A. Many reputable statisticians believed that smoking might partially protect smokers from lung disease and reduce lung cancer rates.
    B. Genetics are a confounding factor in the statistics relating smoking to lung disease.
    C. Cultural, societal, and environmental differences (other than smoking rates) between Nevada and Utah may be partially responsible for increased lung disease in Nevada.
    D. The only reasonable explanation for the Surgeon General's (Luther L. Terry, M.D) delayed warning about the risks of smoking is that he was persuaded by tobacco industry lobbyists.

A1: D

Q2: "Which of the following is **NOT** one of the Bradford Hill Criteria (evidence of causality):
    A. The number of corroborating studies and the total number of subjects (patients) in the studies.
    B. Whether the predictor variable has only the one specific effect hypothesized rather than many other effects.
    C. The reputation and number of citations of the principle investigator on the study.
    D. High correlation magnitude (i.e. Pierson Correlation coefficient close to a value of 1.0).
    E. A plausible biological mechanism or chemical pathway that could explain the cause->effect relationship.
    F. A strong biological gradient or dose-response correlation between the cause and the biological effect on the organism.

Q3: "Which is the correct calculation of a person's likelihood of having cancer given the following information about a particular diagnostic test that came back positive after a checkup with a person's general practitioner: P(T) = 10%, the probability that this test will indicate a positive result (cancer) for a random patient visiting their general practitioner, whether or not the patient actually has cancer. P(C) = 0.1%, the probability of a person in the general population actually having cancer. P(T|C) = 80%, the probability of the test detecting cancer when a patient truly has cancer.:
    A. P(C|T) = P(T|C) * P(C) / P(T) = 80 * .1   / 10          = 80%
    B. P(C|T) = P(T|C) * P(C) / P(T) = .8 * .001 / .1   = .008 = .8%
    C. P(C|T) = P(T|C) * P(T) / P(C) = .8 * .1   / .001 = .8   = 80%
    D. P(C|T) = P(T|C) * P(T) / P(C) = 80 * 10   / .1          = 80%
    E. P(C|T) = P(T|C) * P(T) / P(C) = 80 * 10   / .1          =  8%
