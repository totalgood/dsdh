1. Discuss the differences between a natural (unintentional) experiment and a randomized control trial (RCT).

A natural experiment takes data that is collected the real world and analyzes it for research purposes. An RCT occurs in a controlled setting with specific subjects and out comes that have been predetermined for research purposes.

1.a. What are the advantages of RCTs over natural experiments?

RCTs are randomized, therefore are less susceptible to certain biases. The variables are controlled and there is a comparator (the placebo), therefore easier to establish a treatment affect and increased ability to determine/account for confounders.

1.b. What are the advantages of natural experiments over RCTs?

Natural experiments are generally cheaper, larger scale,  more realistic setting (ie: patient populations are less homogenous ) and therefore likely more generalizable. Data is less likely to be influenced by expected outcomes (ie, desire to get a drug approved, minimize adverse events) as the setting is real life.

1.c. Can you think of any challenges for natural experiments that were not mentioned in the lecture?

Difficult to adjust for confounders as this data is likely not being collected, therefore question of causality may be more difficult to ascertain.  Missing data is more likely than in an RCT, as there is unlikely someone who is dedicated to the task of data collection. Likely variability in data collection/entry methods and reliability of data for this reason.

2. Share at least one possible (exogenous) cause of growth rate variability in guinea pig birth weight besides litter size. See RR1 (required reading 1) Growth rate variability in guinea pigs is possible with changes in dietary patterns and food availability which can be impacted by weather, geography and competing animals.
